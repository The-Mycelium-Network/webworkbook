# Contributing to web://workbook

## Guidelines

The main intent of the web://workbook project is to be a curated resource for web developers with a focus on those new to computers and technology.

### What is curation?

One of the definitions of curation according to the [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curation) is as follows:

> The act or process of selecting and bringing together people or groups for a specific purpose

Now if you replace people with content, that would be an accurate description of what curation means in the context of the web://workbook.

With that said, curation does not mean copying. While you can, and should, use quotations from works that explain a topic well, there are a couple of points to remember:

1. Never copy large portions of text verbatim i.e. using exactly the same words; corresponding word for word.
2. Always reference, and link to your sources.
3. Always put the quoted text as a block quote. [Block quotes in Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/05-blockquotes.html)

In Markdown, which is the language we use to write our content, you write a quote as follows:

```markdown
> The quoted text. This text can also span
> multiple lines.
```

When written as above it will display as follows:

> The quoted text. This text can also span
> multiple lines.

Even though the use of quotes is not forbidden, using quotes that are more than a single paragraph is also not acceptable. In these instances, it would be better to write a short [synopsis](https://www.wordnik.com/words/synopsis) and link to the full text.

## Guidelines enforcement

If a contributor opens a pull request that goes against these guidelines, the pull request will not be accepted. If this happens a second time, the pull request will be closed, and the contributor will receive an official warning. If this happens a third time, the contributor will be banned from the project.

We ask that you respect everyone's time and follow these guidelines.

## Hugo

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for statically generating our site contents. Therefore, to develop locally, you’ll need to install Hugo. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

Once installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
hugo server
```

Once the server starts, point your browser to `http://localhost:1313` to view the site.

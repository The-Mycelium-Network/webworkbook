Github is a hub for programmers, designers, technical writers, open-source enthusiasts, and the AI companions that can help them along the way.

Github creates spaces for people to come together and solve problems - like setting up the code for a more renewable system on farms, so farmers can better track soil moisture and save water for both themselves and for the health of our planet.

With the help of other programmers, Github Copilot and CodeQL, the result of your hard work is far less likely to have any vulnerabilities, and you can merge confidently.

GitHub is the most popular platform for open-source enthusiasts to collaborate on code projects by using the software Git. GitHub is very user friendly, even complete beginners can learn to use GitHub in hardly any time at all. This capability can help new programmers build up their resumes by doing Pull Requests, and interacting with the community in other ways.

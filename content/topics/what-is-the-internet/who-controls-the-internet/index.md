## Who controls the internet?

The development of the internet is difficult to determine. It was created via a collective, therefore it is difficult to pinpoint how many were involved.

In the beginning, the internet was headed towards decentralization. As of today, large companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have much control over the internet.

In other countries such as North Korea, China, Turkey, Indonesia, and Iran, the government has direct control over the internet.

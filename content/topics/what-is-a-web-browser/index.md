---

A web browser, in simple terms, is an app on your computer, phone, tablet or other internet-enabled devices that allows you to get data from the internet and displays it to you.

For example, when you type in 'www.duckduckgo.com' and hit enter, the browser gets the necessary files (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Images, and more) from DuckDuckGo's servers, combines, parses, and renders (or paints) the page which you can then interact with.

## Chromium-based browsers

[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/ "The Chromium Project") is a free and open-source browser, which means that the source code used to create it is freely available and written by contributors. Because of its open-source nature, anyone can contribute to the Chromium project or, create a fork (copy) of the project to create their own version of the browser.

The most popular example of a Chromium-based browser is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "Google Chrome"). However, a lot of other browsers today are built on top of Chromium, including Brave, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi and Samsung Internet.

One major advantage of using Chromium-based browsers is that extensions that work with Google Chrome work with them too!

## WebKit-based browsers

WebKit is the open-source browser engine used mainly by Safari. Webkit is maintained by Apple computers and mainly used by the Safari web browser. A browser engine is a core part of every major browser responsible for converting HTML and other resources into what you see on your screen.

Safari is the major browser on all Apple devices including iPhones, iPads and Macs. You might also be surprised to know that, right now, all browsers on iOS use Safari as their rendering engine. This means that even if you install Chrome on iOS, it is still essentially Safari. The only thing that is different is the UI and UX provided by Chrome for example. For web developers, if you find a bug in Safari on iOS, it will also exist in Chrome on iOS.

You can read more about WebKit [here](https://webkit.org/ "here") and on its Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit "page").

## Mozilla Firefox

Mozilla Firefox is a free and open-source browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. As mentioned, Safari browsers use the Webkit rendering engine. What we did not mention is that Chromium-based browsers use a fork of Webkit called Blink. At the core of the Firefox browser is the Gecko rendering engine as well as component of the [Servo](https://servo.org/) engine.

Firefox brands itself as a secure and privacy-focused web browser that doesn't sell its user's data to advertisers. This [FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/faq/) from Mozilla provides answers to some common questions about the browser.

Mozilla's history is quite interesting as it is seen as a 'spiritual successor' to Netscape Navigator, a historic and popular browser of the early internet. The documentary below is a really interesting look into the story behind the creation of Firefox.

    name: What is a web browser?
---

A web browser, in simple terms, is an app on your computer, phone, tablet or other internet-enabled devices that allows you to get data from the internet and displays it to you.

For example, when you type in 'www.google.com' and hit enter, the browser gets the necessary files (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Images and more) from Google's servers and paints up the page (rendering) which is shown to you.

This article breaks down the different parts and features of a browser with simple explanations and images: [Internet Basics - Using a Web Browser](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetbasics/using-a-web-browser/1/ "Internet Basics - Using a Web Browser")

## Chromium-based browsers

Chromium is a free and open-source browser, which means that the code used to create it is freely available and written by contributors. Then, different groups/people can play with it and shape it to whatever form they like, in the process creating their own browser.

The most popular example of a chromium-based browser is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "Google Chrome"). However, a lot of other browsers today are built on top of Chromium, including Brave, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi and Samsung Internet.

One major advantage of using Chromium-based browsers is that extensions that work with Google Chrome work with them too!

## WebKit-based browsers

WebKit is the browser engine used mainly by the Safari Browser as well as many other apps on macOS, iOS and Linux. A browser engine is a core part of every major browser responsible for converting HTML and other resources into what you see on your screen.

Safari is the major browser on all Apple devices including iPhones, iPads and Macs. You might also be surprised to know that, right now, all browsers on iOS use Safari as their rendering engine. This means that even if you install Chrome on iOS, it is still Safari. The only thing that is different is the UI and UX provided by Chrome for example. For web developers, if you find a bug in Safari on iOS, it will also exist in Chrome on iOS.

You can read more about WebKit [here](https://webkit.org/ "here") and on its Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit "page").

## Mozilla Firefox

Mozilla Firefox is a free and open-source browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. At its core is the Gecko browser engine similar to WebKit for Safari as mentioned above.

Firefox brands itself as a secure and privacy-focused web browser that doesn't sell its user's data to advertisers.

This [FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/faq/) from Mozilla provides answers to some common questions about the browser.

Mozilla's history is quite interesting as it is seen as a 'spiritual successor' to Netscape Navigator, a historic and popular browser of the early internet. The documentary below is a really interesting look into the story behind the creation of Firefox.

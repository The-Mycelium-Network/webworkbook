# Dial-up

## What is a dial-up connection?

`<p>A dial-up connection is established when two or more communication devices use a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP) at data transfer rates (DTR) of 56kbps, according to [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25953/dial-up-connection)</p>`

`<p>This means your computer connects to an active phone line and dials a number in order to connect to your ISP via an analog modem.</p>`

`<p>The phone line cannot be in use during the connection and when making the connection.</p>`

# Broadband

## What is broadband connection?

`<p>Broadband refers to high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional dial-up access. According to the [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/general/types-broadband-connections), broadband internet should be capable of a minimum of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds.</p>`

## Broadband includes several types of high-speed internet technologies such as:

# Fiber

`<p>According to [Enterprise Spectrum](https://enterprise.spectrum.com/support/faq/internet/how-does-fiber-internet-work.html) Fiber Internet provides Internet access using fiber-optic cable rather than traditional copper cable or satellite signals. Fiber-optic lines consist of up to hundreds of small strands of glass or plastic cables, each about 1/10th the size of a single human hair. Each strand of fiber cable transmits data using pulses of light that travel at speeds approaching the speed of light.</p>`

# DSL

`<p>DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) operates over standard copper telephone lines like dial-up service but is many times faster than dial-up. In addition, unlike dial-up, DSL does not tie up the phone line. Coexisting with telephone service in this way allows users to surf the Net and use the phone at the same time, according to [Easy Tech Junkie](https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-dsl.htm)</p>`

`<p>There are two types of DSL,namely Assymetric DSL (ADSL) and Symmetric DSL (SDSL).</p>`

# Cable

`<p>[Techslang](https://www.techslang.com/what-is-cable-internet-and-how-does-it-work/) explains that Cable Internet is a form of high-speed connection that uses a cable television infrastructure to provide access to end users. Therefore, the network that provides your cable TV connection is the same one that allows you to access the Internet.</p>`

# Satellite

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cZB8E6lh8Y&ab_channel=DWShift)

`<p>Unlike land-based internet services like DSL, fibre or cable which received its signal from cables either below or slightly above the ground, satellite internet is a wireless connection beamed down from satellites orbiting the earth.</p>`

# Wireless

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hePLDVbULZc&ab_channel=BRIGHTSIDE]

`<p>According to [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/articles/internet-essentials/broadband-definition/),Wireless broadband (Wi-Fi) connects a home or business to the internet using radio signals instead of cables.</p>`

# Cellular

## (EDGE, 3G, H+, 4G, 5G)

`<p>[Cnet](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/cellular-home-internet-overview/#:~:text=Cellular%20internet%20works%20by%20using,you%20have%20and%20other%20factors.) states Cellular internet works by using a router or hotspot to connect to a provider's cellular network, just like your mobile phone.</p>`

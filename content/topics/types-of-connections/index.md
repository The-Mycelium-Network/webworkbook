# Dial-up

## What is a dial-up connection?

According to [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25953/dial-up-connection), a dial-up connection is established when two or more communication devices use a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) at Data Transfer Rates (DTR) of 56kbps.

This means your computer connects to an active phone line and dials a number in order to connect to your ISP via an analog modem.

The phone line cannot be in use during the connection or when making the connection.

# Broadband

## What is broadband connection?

Broadband refers to high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional dial-up access. According to the [US Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/general/types-broadband-connections), broadband internet should be capable of a minimum of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds. You can find out [more about broadband internet speeds here](https://www.lifewire.com/broadband-internet-speeds-explained-437202).

Broadband includes several types of high-speed internet technologies such as:

## Fiber

According to [Enterprise Spectrum](https://enterprise.spectrum.com/support/faq/internet/how-does-fiber-internet-work.html), Fiber Internet provides Internet access using fiber-optic cable rather than traditional copper cable or satellite signals. Fiber-optic lines consist of up to hundreds of small strands of glass or plastic cables, each about 1/10th the size of a single human hair. Each strand of fiber cable transmits data using pulses of light that travel at speeds approaching the speed of light.

## DSL

{{< youtube id="mI6Uh6D3NvA" title="What is DSL" >}}

According to [Easy Tech Junkie](https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-dsl.htm), DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) operates over standard copper telephone lines like dial-up service but is many times faster than dial-up. In addition, unlike dial-up, DSL does not tie up the phone line. Coexisting with telephone service in this way allows users to surf the Net and use the phone at the same time.

There are two types of DSL, namely Asymmetric DSL (ADSL) and Symmetric DSL (SDSL). _Learn more about the [different types of DSL technology here](https://www.lifewire.com/different-types-of-dsl-technology-817522)_.

## Cable

{{< youtube id="IOZjdDHYB0g" title="How cable internet works" >}}

[Techslang](https://www.techslang.com/what-is-cable-internet-and-how-does-it-work/) explains that Cable Internet is a form of high-speed connection that uses a cable television infrastructure to provide access to end users. Therefore, the network that provides your cable TV connection is the same one that allows you to access the Internet.

## Satellite

{{< youtube id="2cZB8E6lh8Y" title="How satellite internet works" >}}

Unlike land-based internet services like DSL, fiber or cable, which receive its signal from cables either below or slightly above the ground, satellite internet is a wireless connection beamed down from satellites orbiting the earth.

According to [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/articles/internet-essentials/broadband-definition/), Wireless broadband (Wi-Fi) connects a home or business to the internet using radio signals instead of cables.

## Cellular

### (EDGE, 3G, H+, 4G, 5G)

{{< youtube id="9OrNuAf6C3I" title="Mobile Network Types as Fast As Possible" >}}

[Cnet](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/cellular-home-internet-overview/#:~:text=Cellular%20internet%20works%20by%20using,you%20have%20and%20other%20factors.) states Cellular internet works by using a router or hotspot to connect to a provider's cellular network, just like your mobile phone.

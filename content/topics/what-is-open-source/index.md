## What is open source?
The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values—what we call "the open source way." Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.

An open source development model is the process used by an open source community project to develop open source software. The software is then released under an open source license, so anyone can view or modify the source code. 

Many open source projects are hosted on GitHub, where you can access repositories or get involved in community projects. Linux®, Ansible, and Kubernetes are examples of popular open source projects. 

At Red Hat, we use an open source software development model to create our enterprise open source products and solutions. Red Hat developers actively participate in hundreds of open source projects across the IT stack.

We start with community-built open source software that meets the needs, partially or fully, of our customers. Red Hat builds upon these open source projects, hardening security, patching vulnerabilities, and adding new enterprise features.

We then contribute these improvements back to the original project for the benefit of the community as a whole.

As customers use our software, they provide feedback, submit bug reports, and request additional features as their needs shift. This input guides Red Hat's development.

During the early years of software development, programmers would often share software in order to learn from one another and grow the field of computer programming.

This spurred the creation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and included David Knuth's TeX typesetting program in 1979 and Richard Stallman's GNU operating system in 1983. In fact, the early web browser Netscape was a free software with source code that would later go on to help develop open source software projects like Mozilla Firefox, a web browser that is still commonly used today.

The FSF later was replaced by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) -- a group of software developers that creates software intended to be freely shared, improved and redistributed by others.

The open source movement has not been without its detractors -- for instance, Microsoft's Jim Allchin, who in 2001 stated that the OSI was an "intellectual property destroyer."

Today, however, Microsoft and many others have joined the free and open source software movement in one way or another. This has created a major shift in how open source software is viewed.

Some other open source project contributors, funders and nonprofits include The Linux Foundation, the WordPress Foundation, Creative Commons, the Android Open Source Project and the Mozilla Foundation.

Open source code is usually stored in a public repository and shared publicly. Anyone can access the repository to use the code independently or contribute improvements to the design and functionality of the overall project.

OSS usually comes with a distribution license. This license includes terms that define how developers can use, study, modify, and most importantly, distribute the software.iii According to the Synopsys Black Duck® KnowledgeBase, five of the most popular licenses are:

MIT License
GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0—this is more restrictive and requires that copies of modified code are made available for public use
Apache License 2.0
GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0
BSD License 2.0 (3-clause, New or Revised)—this is less restrictiveiv
When source code is changed, OSS must include what was altered as well as the methods involved. Depending on the license terms, the software resulting from these modifications may or may not be required to be made available for free.iii

To summarize, the open source definition designates that:

An open source software license is free of charge and redistribution is allowed to anyone without any restriction.
The source code must be made available so that the receiving party will be able to improve or modify it.
The license can require improved versions of the software to carry a different name or version from the original software.
The software may be ported to a new operating system.
There have been many notable and widely used open source software licensing agreements to adopt the definition of open source in recent years including:

The Apache web server license
The Berkeley Software Distribution license
The GNU General Public License
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology License
The Mozilla Public License
